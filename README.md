# Jonathan-Tomagotchi-Project

Purpose -This was a tomagotchi project that I had done during the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Program. The purpose of this project was to take everything we learned so far in Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a functioning Tomagotchi game. We needed to put together a web page using HTML and then style it using CSS. The rest of the functionality for the game such as the buttons came from using Javascript. 

How it works - Essentially the goal of the game is to keep your pet or tomagotchi levels of hunger, sleepiness or boredom from reaching zero for as long as possible. The way to do that is to keep feeding it, allowing it to sleep, or entertaining it by clicking the buttons. Once the tomagotchi passes on, the player will be prompted with an end message, some end music, and a suprise image! However, not all hope is lost as the player is able to restart the game by pressing on the "A New Hope" button. If you are a die-hard Star Wars fan like I am, you'll see what I did there!

Inspiration - I really wanted to pay homage to my childhood by creating a Star Wars themed tomagotchi game. When I was young I loved watching the Star Wars movies and shows, and playing with the Lego themed Star Wars sets. Now that I am older, there's really not much time for fun and games. Until I had the opportunity to build this game. 

Why is this important - While this may seem like just a game, I really think the lessons I learned as I was doing this project is what makes this project important. Of course along the way I became a better coder as I was able to debug my problems and try to use advanced concepts like classes and inheritance. I enjoyed the triuphs I experienced when I figured out the answer to difficult challenges that took hours to solve. But what I enjoyed most was that I was able to not just be a better coder but a better human being. When I had the chance, I helped my classmates when they were struggling with parts of their code. I would help coach them on how I would approach the problem they are having while at the same time they helped me practice my presentation skills and explaining solutions coherently. In addition, my classmates gave me ideas and resources that helped made my project even better. 

How I would improve this project - I think ways I would improve this project is to make the page responsive with more advanced css. One thing I would like to also do is use classes and inheritance more by creating a baby tomagotchi. All and all, for my first coding project I'm pretty proud of the work that I was able to put forth in the short time frame that I had. 

Languages Used - HTML, CSS, Javascript
